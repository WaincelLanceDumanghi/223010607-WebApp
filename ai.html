        <h3>AI collaboration in the Workplace</h3>
        <p>Rather than replacing human workers, <em>AI is often viewed as a collaborative tool.</em>
            For example, in the customer service, AI chatbots can handle routine queries,
            allowing <em>human employees to focus on more complex issues</em> that require empathy
            and problem-solving skills.</p>
